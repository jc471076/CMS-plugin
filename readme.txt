My website name is U3A. The website for university of third age. The website link is http://mayureshl.sgedu.site/
For this website I create one plugine name as My Youtube which is used for youtube subscription.
Once the youtube icon is clicked it takes the user to a youtube channel. Then the user can subscribe and watch the videos.
To make this plugin we need the follow the steps mentioned below:
1. Create one  My Youtube plugin folder to view a wordpress web-content/ plugin folder.
2. Open Netbeans and see the plugin folder which you created and create one file inside your plugin folder named as youtubesubs.php
3. Then we wrote a plugine code and create main.js file where we wrote console.log('YTS Loaded...');
4.then we created 2 php files youtubesubs-scripts.php and youtubesubs-class.php.
5. After file creation we uploaded our files on github repository .https://github.com/jc471076/CMS-plugin.git this repository is public so anyone can use it but will not plegurised for their personal reasons.
